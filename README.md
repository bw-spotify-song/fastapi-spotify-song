## Project Goals

Describe the established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day one.

A: List of songs, basic info about songs, song name, artist, album, length of song, genre, general classification/categorization, number of plays, indicator of how much you might like song

Write a description for what the data science problem is. Discover an uncertainty and/or a prediction. Use the data to find a solution to this problem.

A: The Data Science team aims to solve the problem of inadequate or inaccurate predictions of songs that the user might enjoy. Current models do not seem to be super effective -- a large portion of our team does not enjoy ~30% of their Discovery Weekly playlist, and we aim to minimize that number (aiming for ~20%)

Create a good song suggestion. Determine how we know the suggestion was good. Determine whether the user would like it or add it to playlist of any kind.

A: From our team's personal experience, listening to a song all the way through without skipping is generally the best indication of whether a song was a good prediction or not. Adding a song to a playlist or liking a song can give an indication about a particularly good suggestion, but we've discovered that most users are not likely to do this on "good suggestions" only "really good suggestions".

Determine the targeted output to deliver to the Web/UX/iOS teams. Ensure JSON format or requested output format is used.

A: The Spotify API already outputs search requests as JSON, which our Data Engineer plans to flatten for ease of data analysis. We plan to change this back to Python via a Flask app when we return it to the backend team.

## Audio Features

- Acoustics (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.)

- Artist Popularity (A value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.)  

- Danceability (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 represents track is most danceable based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.)

- Duration_MS (The duration of the track in milliseconds.)

- Energy (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 representing a measure of intensity and activity. For example, acid screamo has high energy whereas trance scores low on the scale.)

- Instrumentalness (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. - Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context.)

- Genre (* A conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style.)

- ID (A string to uniquely identify the Spotify ID for a track. For example, '1kKLWkqyZEnrOd5tBYYCUn',)

- Liveness (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A value above 0.8 provides confidence the track is live.) 

- Loudness (Amplitude level ranging from -60 to 0 decibels (dB).)

- Mode (Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.)

- Speechiness (Confidence levels ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 to detect the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. podcast, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.) 

- Tempo (The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.)

- URI (A string to uniquely identify the Spotify URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for a track. For example, 'spotify:track:7lEptt4wbM0yJTvSG5EBof':
https://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/overheard/files/2016/11/URI.png.)

- Year (Production year of a track.)


Reason for using K-nearest neighbors: We chose to work with nearest neighbors because of its ability to cluster observations around common features. Since we were working a tabular dataset it seemed best to avoid any type of neural networks. There was also no need to apply any NLP techniques because there was justifiable reason to use it on any of the columns that contained text. Instead we dummy encoded the genres because most songs had multiple genres/sub genres. 

Results:  We were able to pull an array of similar song suggestions when we would input a single song ID.

Further research: We have begun working on applying text classification to the lyrics of the songs to see if we can get a different type of recommendation that is still useful and appreciated by the user.

## Big Picture

Here's a template with starter code to deploy an API for your machine learning model and data visualizations.  

You can deploy on Heroku in 10 minutes. Here's the template deployed as-is: [https://ds-bw-test.herokuapp.com/](https://ds-bw-test.herokuapp.com/)

This diagram shows two different ways to use frameworks like Flask. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7278219/87967396-5a6fed80-ca84-11ea-902a-890cfa6115d3.png)

Instead of Flask, use FastAPI. It's similar, but faster, with automatic interactive docs. For more comparison, see [FastAPI for Flask Users](https://amitness.com/2020/06/fastapi-vs-flask/).

Build and deploy a Data Science API. May need to work cross-functionally with a Web teammate to connect the API to a full-stack web app!

`app/main.py` is where you edit the app's title and description, which are displayed at the top of the automatically generated documentation. This file also configures "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing", which you shouldn't need to edit. 

- [FastAPI docs - First Steps](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)
- [FastAPI docs - Metadata](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/)
- [FastAPI docs - CORS](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/)

`app/api/predict.py` defines the **Machine Learning** endpoint. `/predict` accepts POST requests and responds with random predictions. In a notebook, train your model and pickle it. Then in this source code file, unpickle your model and edit the `predict` function to return real predictions.

- [Scikit-learn docs - Model persistence](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html)
- [Keras docs - Serialization and saving](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/)

When the API receives a POST request, FastAPI automatically parses and validates the request body JSON, using the `Item` class attributes and functions. Edit this class so it's consistent with the column names and types from the training dataframe.

- [pydantic docs - Validators](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/)

`app/api/viz.py` defines the **Visualization** endpoint. Currently `/viz/{statecode}` accepts GET requests where `{statecode}` is a 2 character US state postal code, and responds with a Plotly figure of the state's unemployment rate, as a JSON string. Create your own Plotly visualizations in notebooks. Then add your code to this source code file. Your web developer teammates can use [react-plotly.js](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs-spa-starter/tree/main/src/components/pages/ExampleDataViz) to show the visualizations.

## Example: Data Visualization

Recommended: Use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), a popular visualization library for both Python & JavaScript.

Follow the [getting started](#getting-started) instructions.

Edit `app/main.py` to add your API `title` and `description`.

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title='World Metrics DS API',
    description='Visualize world metrics from Gapminder data',
    version='0.1',
    docs_url='/',
)
```

Prototype the visualization in a notebook.

```python
import plotly.express as px

dataframe = px.data.gapminder().rename(columns={
    'year': 'Year', 
    'lifeExp': 'Life Expectancy', 
    'pop': 'Population', 
    'gdpPercap': 'GDP Per Capita'
})

country = 'United States'
metric = 'Population'
subset = dataframe[dataframe.country == country]
fig = px.line(subset, x='Year', y=metric, title=f'{metric} in {country}')
fig.show()
```

Define a function for the visualization. End with `return fig.to_json()`

Then edit `app/api/viz.py` to add the code.

```python
import plotly.express as px

dataframe = px.data.gapminder().rename(columns={
    'year': 'Year', 
    'lifeExp': 'Life Expectancy', 
    'pop': 'Population', 
    'gdpPercap': 'GDP Per Capita'
})

@router.get('/worldviz')
async def worldviz(metric, country):
    """
    Visualize world metrics from Gapminder data

    ### Query Parameters
    - `metric`: 'Life Expectancy', 'Population', or 'GDP Per Capita'
    - `country`: [country name](https://www.gapminder.org/data/geo/), case sensitive

    ### Response
    JSON string to render with react-plotly.js
    """
    subset = dataframe[dataframe.country == country]
    fig = px.line(subset, x='Year', y=metric, title=f'{metric} in {country}')
    return fig.to_json()
```

Test locally, then [deploy to Heroku](#deploying-to-heroku). 

Your web teammates can re-use the [data viz code & docs in our `labs-spa-starter` repo](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs-spa-starter/tree/main/src/components/pages/ExampleDataViz). The web app will call the DS API to get the data, then use `react-plotly.js` to render the visualization.

## Example: Machine Learning

Follow the [getting started](#getting-started) instructions.

Edit `app/main.py` to add your API `title` and `description`.

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title='House Price DS API',
    description='Predict house prices in California',
    version='0.1',
    docs_url='/',
)
```

Edit `app/api/predict.py` to add a docstring for the predict function and return a naive baseline. 

```python
@router.post('/predict')
async def predict(item: Item):
    """Predict house prices in California."""
    y_pred = 200000
    return {'predicted_price': y_pred}
```

In a notebook, explore the data. Make an educated guess of what features you could use.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

# Load data
california = fetch_california_housing()
print(california.DESCR)
X = pd.DataFrame(california.data, columns=california.feature_names)
y = california.target

# Rename columns
X.columns = X.columns.str.lower()
X = X.rename(columns={'avebedrms': 'bedrooms', 'averooms': 'total_rooms'})

# Explore descriptive stats
X.describe()
```

```python
# Use these 3 features
features = ['bedrooms', 'total_rooms', 'house_age']
```

Edit the class in `app/api/predict.py` to use the features.

```python
class House(BaseModel):
    """Use this data model to parse the request body JSON."""
    bedrooms: int
    total_rooms: float
    house_age: float

    def to_df(self):
        """Convert pydantic object to pandas dataframe with 1 row."""
        return pd.DataFrame([dict(self)])

@router.post('/predict')
async def predict(house: House):
    """Predict house prices in California."""
    X_new = house.to_df()
    y_pred = 200000
    return {'predicted_price': y_pred}
```

Test locally, then [deploy to Heroku](#deploying-to-heroku) with the work-in-progress. Now your web teammates can make POST requests to the API endpoint.

In a notebook, train the pipeline and pickle it. See these docs:

- [Scikit-learn docs - Model persistence](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html)
- [Keras docs - Serialization and saving](https://keras.io/guides/serialization_and_saving/)

Get version numbers for every package you used in the pipeline. [Install the exact versions of these packages](#more-instructions) in your virtual environment.

Edit `app/api/predict.py` to unpickle the model and use it in your predict function. 

Now you are ready to re-deploy! 🚀
